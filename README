Volatility range:
Homes not close to the river have a wider price range, with some outliers going outside the box. This may indicate that even though there are some houses that are not close to the river, they still have a high value, possibly due to other factors such as size or quality of the hous.-

Homes near rivers have higher average values ​​and less variation than homes not near rivers. This shows that a location near the river can ensure a more stable home va

As the number of rooms increases, house prices also tend to increase. This makes sense because homes with more rooms tend to be larger in size and have a higher value.

Conclusion: The larger the average number of rooms, the higher the average home price, reflecting the fact that larger homes are generally worth more. The dispersion of the data also shows that there are houses with few rooms but still high prices, which may be related to factors other than house size.
